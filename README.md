### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vivek, a Bioinformatics Ph.D. candidate in the [Parker Lab](https://theparkerlab.org) at the
[University of Michigan](https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/).

I am interested in understanding the structure of genome and its organization.
How is the information encoded in genome and epigenome? How does it encode cell phenotype?
What happens when the order of events is disrupted and why does it lead to a disease how does it cause a disease when the delicate order of events is disrupted?
These are some of the questions that I attempt to answer by drawing from integrated experimental, quantitative, and computational approaches.

I am also hooked to open-source software development â€” an ambitious outgrowth of my personal interest to create free and open-source content.
